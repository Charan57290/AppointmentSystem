# Project Description:
This project aims to optimize doctor availability and appointment allocation in hospitals through the implementation of digital technology. The goal is to streamline the process of scheduling appointments for patients while ensuring that doctors are efficiently utilized based on their availability and expertise.

# Ideas:
Digital Appointment Booking System: Develop a user-friendly platform where patients can easily book appointments with doctors based on their availability and specialization.

Doctor Availability Management: Implement a system to track and manage the availability of doctors in real-time, allowing for efficient allocation of appointments.

Patient Prioritization: Prioritize patient appointments based on urgency and medical needs to ensure timely access to healthcare services.

Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR): Integrate the appointment booking system with EHR to provide doctors with access to patient records during appointments, facilitating better-informed decisions.

Automated Reminders and Notifications: Send automated reminders and notifications to patients regarding their upcoming appointments to reduce no-shows and improve overall appointment adherence.

# Project Detail:
User Registration and Authentication: Users (both patients and doctors) can register and authenticate themselves on the platform to access its features securely.

Appointment Booking Interface: Patients can search for doctors based on various criteria such as specialization, location, and availability. They can then book appointments at their preferred time slots.

Doctor Availability Management: Doctors can set their availability preferences, which are updated in real-time based on their schedules. The system automatically adjusts appointment slots accordingly.

Appointment Prioritization: The system prioritizes appointments based on factors such as medical urgency, patient history, and doctor's availability to ensure efficient allocation of resources.

Integration with EHR: During appointments, doctors have access to patient records through the integrated EHR system, enabling them to provide personalized and informed care.

Automated Reminders: Patients receive automated reminders and notifications via email or SMS about their upcoming appointments, reducing the likelihood of missed appointments.

Feedback and Review System: After each appointment, patients can provide feedback and reviews about their experience, which helps improve the quality of service and doctor-patient interactions.
